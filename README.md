# Second-order-Optimisation-on-Pokemon
This is an attempt to implement Newton's method to find the line of best fit on a dataset from kaggle.

This project is a direct continuation of my project here https://goo.gl/814HXw.

The chief change in this project is that I used Newton's Method to optimize my loss function instead of Steepest Descent.
